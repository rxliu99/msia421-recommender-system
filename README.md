# Spotify Track Recommender System Project

Team members: Jade (Yiyang) Cao, Betty (Yi) Chen, Cindy (Yuexin) Chen, and Michelle (Ruoxuan) Liu

# Project Summary
Spotify’s track dataset on Kaggle contains diverse information about songs such as their artists, popularity, and genres. Significant business values can be generated if the dataset is used to encourage users to explore new songs similar to their current interest.
To achieve this, we first performed Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering Analysis to identify groups of similar songs. Then we built two recommender systems--popularity-based and content-based--to recommend songs in the same cluster as the one an user inputs. Text-based simple interfaces were implemented to accept user input and present output.
